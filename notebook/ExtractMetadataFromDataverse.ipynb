Its central objectives were defined as, To contribute to the search for new pasture germplasm for the different production ecosystems prevalent in the poor, acid soils of the vast agricultural frontiers of the continent; Developing extrapolations based on knowledge of the range of ecosystems and subecosystems to which germplasm can adapt; Developing and promoting scientific capabilities within the network in order to achieve efficiency in the experimentation process, which, in a dynamic and sequential manner, will incorporate promising germplasm in pastures and put these in appropriate production systems.(Toledo, 1982) To fulfill these objectives, RIEPT was relied on Regional Trials A (RTAs) representing major ecosystems (well-drained isohyperthennic and isothennic savannas; poorly drained savannas; and rainy and semievergreen seasonal tropical forests), and carried out Regional Trials B (RTBs) at sites representative of the subecosystems found within these five major ecosystems. In the RTAs, an evaluation of the adaptation potential of germplasm under the conditions of a major ecosystem was first made, that is, the potential survival of the germplasm is assessed. The materials that survive and also show a high degree of productivity were exposed to subecosystem conditions in the RTBs, where evaluations were conducted under cutting to measure seasonal productivity (that is, under maximum and minimum rainfall), and so obtain a measurement that integrates adaptability and productivity potential. Until this stage, evaluations were made monoculture, in small plots, with the only purpose of selecting germplasm adapted to the natural conditions (soil, climate, biotic pressures) of different ecosystems. By using uniform evaluation methodologies, it was possible to make multilocational analyses that could extrapolate from known adaptation ranges of the selected germplasm. However, that agronomic experimentation (RTAs and RTBs) was not in any way sufficient to comply with the final objective of incorporating new germplasm options in pastures for animal production systems at the continent's agricultural frontiers. RIEPT therefore proposed to carry out regional trials under grazing in two phases. In the first, known as Regional Trials C (RTCs), the idea was to incorporate new germplasm in pastures to study its potential compatibility under grazing in small plots in terms of productivity (dry-matter yields and carrying capacity) and persistence (dynamics of botanical composition, changes in plant architecture, and seed reserves) under different grazing management systems. In the second phase, Regional Trials D (RTDs), the best pastures in terms of productivity, persistence, and ease of management were compared with the best pastures under traditional use. In these trials, pasture productivity as animal products (beef, milk, and calves) within the context of the predominant production system in each region were measured.

Its central objectives were defined as, To contribute to the search for new pasture germplasm for the different production ecosystems prevalent in the poor, acid soils of the vast agricultural frontiers of the continent; Developing extrapolations based on knowledge of the range of ecosystems and subecosystems to which germplasm can adapt; Developing and promoting scientific capabilities within the network in order to achieve efficiency in the experimentation process, which, in a dynamic and sequential manner, will incorporate promising germplasm in pastures and put these in appropriate production systems.(Toledo, 1982) To fulfill these objectives, RIEPT was relied on Regional Trials A (RTAs) representing major ecosystems (well-drained isohyperthennic and isothennic savannas; poorly drained savannas; and rainy and semievergreen seasonal tropical forests), and carried out Regional Trials B (RTBs) at sites representative of the subecosystems found within these five major ecosystems. In the RTAs, an evaluation of the adaptation potential of germplasm under the conditions of a major ecosystem was first made, that is, the potential survival of the germplasm is assessed. The materials that survive and also show a high degree of productivity were exposed to subecosystem conditions in the RTBs, where evaluations were conducted under cutting to measure seasonal productivity (that is, under maximum and minimum rainfall), and so obtain a measurement that integrates adaptability and productivity potential. Until this stage, evaluations were made monoculture, in small plots, with the only purpose of selecting germplasm adapted to the natural conditions (soil, climate, biotic pressures) of different ecosystems. By using uniform evaluation methodologies, it was possible to make multilocational analyses that could extrapolate from known adaptation ranges of the selected germplasm. However, that agronomic experimentation (RTAs and RTBs) was not in any way sufficient to comply with the final objective of incorporating new germplasm options in pastures for animal production systems at the continent's agricultural frontiers. RIEPT therefore proposed to carry out regional trials under grazing in two phases. In the first, known as Regional Trials C (RTCs), the idea was to incorporate new germplasm in pastures to study its potential compatibility under grazing in small plots in terms of productivity (dry-matter yields and carrying capacity) and persistence (dynamics of botanical composition, changes in plant architecture, and seed reserves) under different grazing management systems. In the second phase, Regional Trials D (RTDs), the best pastures in terms of productivity, persistence, and ease of management were compared with the best pastures under traditional use. In these trials, pasture productivity as animal products (beef, milk, and calves) within the context of the predominant production system in each region were measured.

The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) was employed to conduct a systematic biophysical baseline of key land and soil health metrics, which was to be combined with agronomic survey data collected as part of the wider project. The LDSF is designed to provide a biophysical baseline at landscape level, and a monitoring and evaluation framework for assessing processes of land degradation and the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures (recovery) over time. Babati Agricultural District Office and Tanzania National Agricultural Research System as well as Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) staff were involved in two one-week trainings in the LDSF methodology at the Long and Matufa LDSF sites. Those trained include: Majid Suleiman (District Agricultural Officer), Edgar Wakurwa (District Agronomist), Mbwambo (Extension Officer), Prosper Massawe from Selian Agricultural Research Institute and Boniface Massawe, from SUA.

The R factor explained between 59 and 81% of the variation in soil loss recorded on continuously clean-tilled fallow plots. The erodibility of Inceptisols in the study region is classified as low. Values for soil erodibility (K) ranged from 0.012 to 0.015 (measured in SI units) in the fifth year of permanent bare fallowing. K factors were higher in the rainy than in the dry season. Soils, previously under grass vegetation, were very resistant to erosion in the first two years of bare fallowing. In the third year erodibility increased sharply and continued to increase steadily until the sixth year. K factors predicted by the USLE nomograph underestimated the empirically-determined erodibility of these highly aggregated clay soils.\",\n",

VEF (for the Spanish acronym of Bean Team Nursery) was an observational nursery; EP (Spanish acronym for Preliminary Trial) a regional yield trial and IBYAN the international yield trial. The scheme worked as follows: The advanced lines (hereinafter referred to as F4) were evaluated under the VEF - EP (both at the national level) - IBYAN (at the international level) scheme. Early generations, in contrast, were handled through a regional division of labor. Breeder I generated materials for Central America and the Mexican humid tropics; breeder II for the Andean Region, the Caribbean, and Africa; and breeder III, for Brazil, Northwest Argentina, the semiarid areas of Mexico, and Western Asia. Each breeder made the necessary contacts with breeders of the targeted regions to support them in developing bean populations according to specific requests and to provide them with sources of resistance to major production constraints. One golden rule followed was that no breeder would send early generation materials to countries outside his work areas to avoid overwhelming national programs with huge amounts of genetic material still being developed. To benefit national programs with the materials produced by all breeders, the Program established that they should deliver their best F4 to be evaluated for one year in the VEF by the entire bean team (pathologist, entomologist, virologist, plant physiologist, and agronomist). The best-performing VEF materials continued on to preliminary yield trials (EP), which, at the same time, served as a basis for selecting those lines that would enter the IBYAN. The three nurseries were at the disposal of the national programs that, accordingly, received the best advanced materials of the three CIAT bean breeders through this channel. The VEF later changed its name to IBN (International Bean Nursery). The VEF(IBN)-EP-IBYAN scheme ceased operating in 1996.\",\n",

A sample of producers from different regions of the country were selected from the SERVISEMILLAS sales list to conduct a telephone survey. The sample included 50 producers throughout Colombia, which provided information on the following aspects: (1) source of information on the legume; (2) number of plot and area planted; (3) problems encountered during establishment; (4) alternative uses; (5) advantages and disadvantages of the legume; and (6) expectations with the legume.\",\n",

The results suggested that the principal research included breeding and selecting for several traits, such as drought tolerance and water use efficiency, improved yields, and consumer acceptance. Additionally, the results of the priority setting process suggested that institutional measures are needed, such as improving formal seed production and distribution channels and the development of national and regional seed policies. On the other hand, the identified principal constraints included diseases, pests, and market constraints. Finally, the identified principal trends were: increase in demand and production, and development of high-yield varieties and improvement in nutritional quality.\",\n",

To complement field studies, a greenhouse study was conducted using plastic cylinders with soil inserted into PVC pipes, to determine the relationship between grain yield obtained under field conditions with different root traits measured under greenhouse conditions. Resistance to drought stress was positively associated with a deeper and vigorous root system, better shoot growth, and superior mobilization of photosynthates to pod and seed production.

Although bean impact has been documented in a number of past studies, the last comprehensive study of the international crop improvement effort, organized by the Standing Panel for Impact Assessment (SPIA, formerly the Impact Assessment and Evaluation Group), was based on data collected a decade ago (Evenson and Gollin, 2003 based on 1997-98 data). Important changes have occurred in the funding and conduct of the international crop improvement effort and in the general climate for agriculture in the developing world since the completion of the Evenson and Gollin study. The level and focus of funding for research in the NARS and in the CGIAR centers have fluctuated greatly, and the role of the private sector has evolved. Yet, the importance of the CGIAR/NARS crop improvement effort in feeding the world is arguably as important today as it has been at any time in history. The steady uptake and turnover of crop varieties is fundamental to realizing a Green Revolution in Africa, and it is still important for helping achieve income growth for numerous poor rural households. But our present understanding of improved variety adoption\\u2014by crop, by location, by adopter and by source\\u2014is limited in Africa. The data seeks to redress this anomaly, by providing a versatile database on bean variety adoption by crop, by location, by adopter and by source in sub-saharan countries.

The objective of this study was to determine the attainable maize grain response to and potential of profitability of N, P and K application in SSA using boundary line approaches. Data from experiments conducted in SSA under AfSIS project (2009\\u20132012) and from FAO trials database (1969\\u20131996) in 15 countries and constituting over 375 different experimental locations and 6600 data points are used. Both response to fertilizer and value cost ratio (VCR) are highly variable and no more than 61 % cases for N, 43 % for P and 25 % for K attain VCR of 2 or more. Also, based on the recent AfSIS data, VCR exceeds 1 in just 67 % (N), 57 % (P) and 40 % (K) of the cases, even when best management practices are applied on a research farm, and interest rates are zero. Chances for profitability are highest when soil organic carbon is 1\\u20132 % and control maize grain yield is 1\\u20133 t ha\\u22121 but also depends on relatively static soil properties (primarily texture and mineralogy) that are not under farmer control. We conclude that return on investment of macronutrient fertilizer is highly variable and can be substantially increased by helping farmers decide where to apply the fertilizers. Consequently, farmers need access to information on factors influencing economic returns of fertilizer use in order to make the right decisions.\",\n",

Methodology/approach: Online data collection using the Learning Transfer Systems Inventory (LTSI) from 139 respondents was made and analyzed using bivariate correlations and hierarchical multiple regression. Findings: An average of 75% of the training skills were perceived as transferred. Personal capacity significantly predicted transfer, while motivation to transfer, transfer design, supervisor and peer support positively correlated with training transfer. Theoretical implications: The Learning Transfer System Inventory factors remain relevant explanations for training transfer with in African agricultural research and development organizations. Certain work environments are likely to have new factors such as \\u2018Peer and supervisor\\u2019 support which operated as one explanatory factor for training transfer, showing the closeness of peers and supervisors in agricultural research and development settings. Practical implications: The international agricultural research network needs to pay attention to the trainees\\u2019 ability to transfer new training, particularly on workload related hindrances. Originality/value: The study has tested out the applicability of the LTSI for international agencies that conduct training for agricultural research and development in Africa. Understanding personal capacity to transfer is critical in this context, suggesting that institutions need policies that enhance trainee capacity to transfer enacted, facilitated and enforced.\",\n",

That these practices' effects on crop population genetics have not been quantified bespeaks lack of an appropriate analytical framework. We use a model that construes seed-management practices as part of a crop's demography to describe the dynamics of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Cauca, Colombia. We quantify several management practices for cassava\\u2014th e first estimates of their kind for a vegetatively-propagated crop\\u2014describe their demographic repercussions, and compare them to those of maize, a sexually-reproduced grain crop. We discuss the implications for gene flow, the conservation of cassava diversity, and the biosafety of vegetatively-propagated crops in centers of diversity. Cassava populations are surprisingly open and dynamic: farmers exchange germplasm across localities, particularly improved varieties, and distribute it among neighbors at extremely high rates vis-\\u00e0-vis maize. This implies that a large portion of cassava populations consists of non-local germplasm, often grown in mixed stands with local varieties. Gene flow from this germplasm into local seed banks and gene pools via pollen has been documented, but its extent remains uncertain. In sum, cassava's biology and vegetative propagation might facilitate pre-release confinement of genetically-modified varieties, as expected, but simultaneously contribute to their diffusion across traditional agroecosystems if released. Genetically-modified cassava is unlikely to displace landraces or compromise their diversity; but rapid diffusion of improved germplasm and subsequent incorporation into cassava landraces, seed banks or wild populations could obstruct the tracking and eradication of deleterious transgenes. Attempts to regulate traditional farming practices to reduce the risks could compromise cassava populations' adaptive potential and ultimately prove ineffectual.\",\n",

As an endophyte, B. bassiana may play a role in protecting plants from herbivory and disease. This protocol demonstrates two inoculation methods to establish B. Bassiana endophytically in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), in preparation for subsequent evaluations of endophytic biological control. Plants are grown from surface-sterilized seeds for two weeks before receiving a B. bassiana treatment of 108 conidia/ml (or water) applied either as a foliar spray or a soil drench. Two weeks later, the plants are harvested and their leaves, stems and roots are sampled to evaluate endophytic fungal colonization.For this, samples are individually surface sterilized, cut into multiple sections, and incubated in potato dextrose agar media for 20 days. The media is inspected every 2-3 days to observe fungal growth associated with plant sections and record the occurrence of B. bassiana to estimate the extent of its endophytic colonization. Analyses of inoculation success compare the occurrence of B. bassiana within a given plant part (i.e., leaves, stems or roots) across treatments and controls. In addition to the inoculation method, the specific outcome of the experiment may depend on the target crop species or variety, the fungal entomopathogen species strain or isolate used, and the plant's growing conditions.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Nicaragua has already experienced substantial climate change, in part due to a loss of one half of its forest cover in the last half-century. In this study, we assess the extent to which historical climate trends have contributed to stagnating yields for maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), the two main staple crops in the country. We first analyze 40 years of historical weather data throughout Nicaragua to estimate trends, and assess the extent to which these trends correlate with spatial deforestation patterns. Then, we create a regression model linking department-level maize and bean yields with seasonal weather conditions, and use the model to estimate the impact of historical climate trends on yields. Regressions are run for yields on both harvested and sown area, with the latter accounting for the effect of complete crop losses. Results confirm strong warming trends throughout the country, with daytime temperatures in deforested areas warming at more than double the rate of global averages in the tropics. Decreases in rainfall frequency are also seen almost everywhere, along with an earlier end to the rainy season. Regression model results show, as expected, that red bean is a highly temperature-sensitive crop, and that maize is more water-limited than bean due to its longer seasonal duration. Warming temperatures and less frequent rainfall have led to drought-related losses for both crops in the main commercial production areas, while heavier rains at planting and harvest have also negatively affected yields, especially for bean. Moreover, reduced precipitation in December and January has negatively impacted production f or bean in the commercially important apante, or dry season, on the humid Atlantic side of the country. In these areas, however, substantial model uncertainty remains for maize, with an alternative model formulation showing substantial benefits from drier and sunnier conditions. At an annual, national scale, beans have been more affected by climate trends since 1970 than maize, with -5% yield declines per decade on harvested area for bean and -4% for maize, and -12% and -7% yield declines respectively on sown area(with the alternative model showing gains for maize). Climate adaptation responses include government efforts to limit bean exports to control consumer prices, a switch from red to black bean for commercial sales and export, and area expansion and migration for bean in order to maintain production levels.\",\n",

This database was also used to determine field capacity, wilting point and water-holding capacity for each point by applying pedotransfer functions according to Saxton & Rawls (2006). A regression kriging approach was performed by combining 80% of point data with the terrain attributes aspect, mid-slope position, normalized height, plan and profile curvature, slope and topographic wetness index generated from a digital elevation model SRTM of 30 meters resolution. The combination of sand, silt, and clay maps resulted on texture class map. The curve number was mapped using the texture and land cover maps according to Soil Conservation Service of the United States of America (USDA-SCS, 1985). The maps performance was evaluated by the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) expressed in percentage and using 20% of data point not used for mapping.

Governments are taking action to address climatic threats, but they need tools to assess the impact of policies and interventions aiming to decrease the impacts of climate change on agriculture. This research, conducted with national policy makers and climate change and agriculture stakeholders in Guatemala, provides a comparative analysis of eight climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and technologies associated with the smallholder maize-beans production system in the Dry Corridor. The practices were identified as high-interest for investment by national stakeholders. CSA practices and technologies aim to improve food security, resilience, and low emissions development, where possible and appropriate. The paper assesses the cost-benefit profile of the introduction of CSA options into farm production systems. Indicators related to profitability and valuation of environmental and social externalities are used to assess options. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is used to address field variability and high uncertainty around parameter values. All practices except one were profitable over their lifecycle, with some practices, expected to be ideal for drought prone areas, presenting a higher risk for adoption. The results were discussed with national stakeholders who established best-bet CSA investment portfolios. This paper argues that a thorough understanding of the costs and benefits of potential CSA options is needed to channel investments effectively and efficiently towards both short- and long-term interventions and should be coupled with broader assessment of trade-offs between CSA outcomes.\",\n",

Dentro de uno de sus objetivos, est\\u00e1 integrar la perspectiva de g\\u00e9nero mediante la evaluaci\\u00f3n de asuntos sociales y de g\\u00e9nero en el sector arrocero y los impactos diferenciados seg\\u00fan g\\u00e9nero de los productos y servicios de GRiSP. Por ello, dentro un de los objetivos es recolectar informaci\\u00f3n desagregada por sexo. Los objetivos del estudio son: a)Caracterizar el sistema de producci\\u00f3n de arroz b)Identificar las variedades de arroz c)Estimar las tasas de adopci\\u00f3n para variedades d)Identificar los factores (socioecon\\u00f3mia, ambiental, mercado) asociadas con la elecci\\u00f3n de variedades de los productores. e)Igualmente, tiene el objetivo de recolectar informaci\\u00f3n desagregada por sexo para identificar la participaci\\u00f3n de las mujeres en la produccion de arroz y brechas de g\\u00e9nero en redimiento y adopci\\u00f3n de variedades. Para ello, se realiz\\u00f3 una encuesta a 497 peque\\u00f1os productores de arroz, con una representaci\\u00f3n estad\\u00edstica y un error muestral de 7%. El muestreo fue aleatorio estratificado por afijaci\\u00f3n proporcional (estrato es igual a comisi\\u00f3n de regantes).\",\n",

The datasets presented here draw from 17 Sub Saharan countries that are members of PABRA. The dataset on released bean varieties is a collection of 357 bean varieties released by NARS and there characteristics. The dataset on bean varieties and the relationship to constraints provides the 357 bean varieties on the basis of resistance to constraints such as fungal, bacterial, viral, diseases and tolerance to abiotic stresses. There is also a dataset of bean varieties that have been released in more than one country, useful for moving seed from one country to another and facilitating regional trade. The dataset on Niche market traits provides the market defined classifications for bean trade in Sub Saharan Africa as well as varieties that fall into these classifications. The datasets are an update to the 2011 discussion on PABRAs achievement in breeding and delivery of bean varieties in Buruchara et. 2011 in pages 236 and 237 here: http://www.ajol.info/index.php/acsj/article/view/74168 .

Three common bean elite lines (NCB 226, SEN 56, SER 125) were identified with superior levels of adaptation to both intermittent and terminal drought stress conditions. The greater performance of these lines under drought stress was associated with their ability to remobilize photosynthate to increase grain yield based on higher values of harvest index, pod harvest index, leaf area index and canopy biomass. Two wild bean germplasm accessions (G 19902, G 24390) showed very poor adaptation to both types of drought stress. One small-seeded black line (NCB 226) was superior in combining greater values of canopy biomass with greater ability to mobilize photosynthates to grain under both types of drought stress. Two small-seeded red lines (SER 78, SER 125) seem to combine the desirable traits of enhanced mobilization of photosynthates to seed with effective use of water through canopy cooling under terminal drought stress. Pod harvest index showed significant positive association with grain yield under both types of drought stress and this trait can be used by breeders as an additional selection method to grain yield in evaluation of breeding populations for both types of drought stress.\",\n",

This necessitates an understanding of economic, climatic, political, agronomic and social considerations. Literature shows how gender roles can influence the adoption of a technology or be affected by the introduction of a new technology. Therefore, a baseline in five departments of Colombia \\u2013 Tolima, Norte de Santander, Cesar, C\\u00f3rdoba and Casanare, was implemented to identify: a) barriers and motivations of farmers to implement AWD and b) gender roles in decision making over rice production and labor. This last to understand: how might gender impact the adoption of AWD in Colombia? And, how will the adoption of AWD affect the gender division of labor? In order to answer these questions, a household survey with sex-disaggregated information was implemented to 609 households with at least one irrigated rice. The implementation of the survey was supported by Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the National Association of Rice in Colombia (FEDEARROZ, by its acronym in Spanish) and the Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)\",\n",

Household surveys were carried out in Cu Jut and Ea Kar districts and farming systems and production specialization were found to differ in each district. Ea Kar farmers were more specialized in livestock production while Cu Jut farmers were more focused on cash crop production. The FarmDESIGN bio-economic model allowed us to study two representative farms, one from Ea Kar and one from Cu Jut district. The Ea Kar farm had a more integrated livestock production system, providing manure to the fields that produced feed for the livestock. Both farms had high farm-level nitrogen balances due to high feed and fertilizer imports. The soil organic matter (SOM) balance in Cu Jut was negative (-48 kg/ha) because of its manure management strategy. On both farms, the residues were removed from the fields, providing no input to SOM and were fed to livestock (Ea Kar) or burnt (Cu Jut). Livestock intensification scenarios that were implemented for the Ea Kar case study farm showed two possible pathways \\u2013 forage-based and grain-based cattle fattening. Both strategies could lead to higher operating profits (+35% for forage-based cattle fattening and +59% for grain-based cattle fattening) and lower labor demands if they were skillfully implemented for the latter scenario. However, grain-based fattening negatively affected SOM balance, in contrast to forage-based fattening. The optimization of the current Ea Kar farm with FarmDESIGN indicated that there are options to change the farm setup in order to increase profitability and reduce family labor demands. However there are some trade-offs to consider. If reducing environmental impact is a priority, there are alternative farm configurations that will produce lower greenhouse gas emissions while increasing SOM and increasing overall farm profitability. These should be assessed along with the farmers\\u2019 interests and priorities. Quantitative farm modeling of complex mixed farming systems can assess potential impact and support decision-making, targeting, prioritization and program design for sustainable intensification of livestock systems.\",\n",

Resistance to terminal drought stress was positively associated with EUW combined with increased dry matter partitioned to pod and seed production and negatively associated with days to flowering and days to physiological maturity. Based on phenotypic differences in CID, leaf stomatal conductance, canopy biomass and grain yield under drought stress, the lines tested were classified into two groups, water savers and water spenders.\",\n",

However, changes in this diversity have not been quantified globally. We assess trends over the past 50 y in the richness, abundance, and composition of crop species in national food supplies worldwide. Over this period, national per capita food supplies expanded in total quantities of food calories, protein, fat, and weight, with increased proportions of those quantities sourcing from energy-dense foods. At the same time the number of measured crop commodities contributing to national food supplies increased, the relative contribution of these commodities within these supplies became more even, and the dominance of the most significant commodities decreased. As a consequence, national food supplies worldwide became more similar in composition, correlated particularly with an increased supply of a number of globally important cereal and oil crops, and a decline of other cereal, oil, and starchy root species. The increase in homogeneity worldwide portends the establishment of a global standard food supply, which is relatively species-rich in regard to measured crops at the national level, but species-poor globally. These changes in food supplies heighten interdependence among countries in regard to availability and access to these food sources and the genetic resources supporting their production, and give further urgency to nutrition development priorities aimed at bolstering food security. This dataset is based on FAO national per capita data. For information on the value addition of the data please see the Materials and Methods section of the publication.\",\n",

The climate smart agriculture rapid appraisal (CSA-RA) is a mixed method approach that draws on participatory bottom-up, qualitative, and quantitative tools to assess the heterogeneity of local contexts, and prioritize context-specific CSA options. This is an imperative if countries are to respond to the COP21 agreement and meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The CSA-RA is designed to assess biophysical including climatic, socio-cultural, economic and technological characteristics at the household, farm and community/regional level. The CSA-RA employs gender-disaggregated methods, including gender differences in perceptions of climate change and its impacts. The CSA-RA combines common participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools into one methodology, that disaggregates the gender dimension, and includes resource mapping; climate calendars; historical calendars; cropping calendars; organization mapping; transect walks; key informant interviews; farmer interviews; and pairwise ranking matrix. The tool collects qualitative and quantitative data from various stakeholders (farmers, local leaders, researchers, local-level agricultural experts, private sector actors, donor organizations, and policy implementers), allowing expansive analysis, triangulation and validation. Application of the CSA-RA in Tanzania and Uganda reveals heterogeneity across the sites in terms of vulnerability, constraints and CSA priorities among different social groups (gender) and agro-ecological zones. Thus, the CSA-RA allows stakeholders to simultaneously take into account biophysical and socio-economic aspects to target and implement CSA.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] is a versatile, stress-tolerant, and nutritious grain legume, possessing traits of value for enhancing the sustainability of dry sub-tropical and tropical agricultural systems. The use of crop wild relatives (CWR) in pigeonpea breeding has been successful in providing important resistance, quality, and breeding efficiency traits to the crop. Current breeding objectives for pigeonpea include increasing its tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat, cold, drought, and waterlogging. Here we assess the potential for pigeonpea CWR to be further employed in crop improvement by compiling wild species occurrence and ex situ conservation information, producing geographic distribution models for the species, identifying gaps in the comprehensiveness of current germplasm collections, and using ecogeographic information to identify CWR populations with the potential to contribute agronomic traits of priority to breeders. The fifteen prioritized relatives of pigeonpea generally occur in South and Southeast Asia to Australia, with the highest concentrations of species in southern India and northern Australia. These taxa differ considerably among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation and edaphic conditions. We find that these wild genetic resources are broadly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems, with 80% of species assessed as high priority for further collecting, thus their availability to plant breeders is insufficient. We identify species and highlight geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of pigeonpea CWR germplasm collections, with particular emphasis on potential traits for abiotic stress tolerance.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"High nitrogen (N) concentration in bovine urine, which generally exceeds plant N uptake rates, results in the formation of hotspots of N loss when bovine urine is deposited on grazed pasture soils. High spatial variability in the distribution of urine patches in grazed pastures poses a major challenge to mitigate N losses. Some exudates from the roots of several tropical forage grasses were shown to inhibit the activity of soil nitrifiers; a process known as biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). We hypothesized that nitrate (NO3\\u2212) production and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from urine patches deposited on soils under forage grasses with high BNI capacity are lower than those with forage grasses with low BNI capacity. This hypothesis was tested using field plots of two tropical forage grass cultivars, Brachiaria humidicola cv. Tully (BT) and interspecific Brachiaria hybrid cv. Mulato (BM) which, correspondingly, have high and low BNI capacity. Nitrification rates and amoA gene copy numbers of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in soils under the two forage grasses were quantified before and after urine and water (control) application, as well, an additional experiment was conducted to quantify denitrification potential. Moreover, soil N2O emissions from simulated urine (0.123 kg N m\\u22122) and water patches were monitored over a 29-day period. Results showed a greater suppression of nitrification, denitrification and AOA abundance in soils under BT than those under BM. Positive relationships (p < 0.05) existed between AOA and AOB abundance and NO3\\u2212 contents in soils under BM. Bovine urine resulted in higher cumulative N2O fluxes from soils under BM (80 mg N2O-N m\\u22122) compared to those under BT (32 mg N2O-N m\\u22122). Consequently, N2O emission factors were higher for soils under BM (0.07%) than under BT (0.00002%). We conclude that tropical forage grasses with high BNI capacity play a key role in mitigating N2O emissions from bovine urine patches in archaea-dominated soils. This suggests that wide-spread adoption of tropical forage grasses with high BNI capacity may have a great potential to tighten N cycling in grazed pastures.\",\n",

The objective of this research is to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the bulk of food production in these areas. A database was developed for use in agricultural research and development targeting and priority setting to raise the productivity of crops on which the poor in marginal environments depend\",\n",

To assess on-farm niches of improved forages, demonstration trials and participatory on-farm research were conducted in four different sites. Forage legumes included Canavalia brasiliensis (CIAT 17009), Stylosanthes guianensis (CIAT 11995) and Desmodium uncinatum (cv. Silverleaf), while grasses were Guatemala grass (Tripsacum andersonii), Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) French Cameroon, and a local Napier line. Within the first six months, forage legumes adapted differently to the four sites with little differences among varieties, while forage grasses displayed higher variability in biomass production among varieties than among sites. Farmers\\u2019 ranking largely corresponded to herbage yield from the first cut, preferring Canavalia, Silverleaf desmodium and Napier French Cameroon. Choice of forages and integration into farming systems depended on land availability, soil erosion prevalence and livestock husbandry system. In erosion prone sites, 55\\u201360%of farmers planted grasses on field edges and 16\\u201330% as hedgerows for erosion control. 43% of farmers grew forages as intercrop with food crops such as maize and cassava, pointing to land scarcity. Only in the site with lower land pressure, 71% of farmers grew legumes as pure stand. When land tenure was not secured and livestock freely roaming, 75% of farmers preferred to grow annual forage legumes instead of perennial grasses. Future research should develop robust decision support for spatial and temporal integration of forage technologies into diverse smallholder cropping systems and agro-ecologies.\",\n",

Lam., I. series Batatas] have the potential to contribute to breeding objectives for this important root crop. Uncertainty in regard to species boundaries and their phylogenetic relationships, the limited availability of germplasm with which to perform crosses, and the difficulty of introgression of genes from wild species has constrained their utilization. Here, we compile geographic occurrence data on relevant sweetpotato wild relatives and produce potential distribution models for the species. We then assess the comprehensiveness of ex situ germplasm collections, contextualize these results with research and breeding priorities, and use ecogeographic information to identify species with the potential to contribute desirable agronomic traits. The fourteen species that are considered the closest wild relatives of sweetpotato generally occur from the central United States to Argentina, with richness concentrated in Mesoamerica and in the extreme Southeastern United States. Currently designated species differ among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation, and edaphic characteristics and most species also show considerable intraspecific variation. With 79% of species identified as high priority for further collecting, we find that these crop genetic resources are highly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems and thus their availability to breeders and researchers is inadequate. We prioritize taxa and specific geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of germplasm collections. In concert with enhanced conservation of sweetpotato wild relatives, further taxonomic research, characterization and evaluation of germplasm, and improving the techniques to overcome barriers to introgression with wild species are needed in order to mobilize these genetic resources for crop breeding.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Secondary and micronutrients are important in enhancing crop productivity; yet, they are hardly studied in sub-Sahara Africa. In this region, the main focus has been on macronutrients but there is emerging though scattered evidence of crop productivity limitations by the secondary and micronutrients. Elsewhere, widespread deficiencies of these nutrients are associated with stagnation of yields. In total, 530 rows of yield data were extracted from the 40 papers of which 49.4% were on sulfur (S) response, 23.0% on Zn, 7.4% on Cu, 3.0% on Mo, 4.5% on Fe, 1.1% on boron (B), and 11.5% involved two or more, i.e., S and micronutrient combinations. Here, we undertake a meta-analysis using 40 articles reporting crop response to secondary and micronutrients to (1) determine the productivity increase of crops and nutrient use efficiency associated with these nutrients, and (2) provide synthesis of responses to secondary nutrients and micronutrients in sub-Sahara Africa. This study used 757 yield data rows (530 from publications and 227 from Africa Soil Information Service) from field trials carried out in SSA between 1969 and 2013 in 14 countries. Data from publications constituted response to S (49.4%), Zn (23.0%), S and micronutrient combinations (11.5%), and <10% each for Cu, Mo, Fe, and B. Data from Africa Soil Information Service were all for S and micronutrient combinations. Of the two sources, most yield data are for maize (73.6%), followed by sorghum (6.7%) and wheat (6.1%) while rice, cowpea, faba bean, tef, and soybean each accounted for less than 5%. The major points are the following: (1) application of S and micronutrients increased maize yield by 0.84 t ha\\u22121 (i.e., 25%) over macronutrient only treatment and achieved agronomic efficiencies (kilograms of grain increase per kilogram of micronutrient added) between 38 and 432 and (2) response ratios were >1 for S and all micronutrients, i.e., the probability of response ratio exceeding 1 was 0.77 for S and 0.83 for Zn, 0.95 for Cu, and 0.92 for Fe, and indicates positive crop response for a majority of farmers. We conclude that S and micronutrients are holding back crop productivity especially on soils where response to macronutrients is low and that more research is needed to unravel conditions under which application of S and micronutrients may pose financial risks.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Crop wild relatives (CWR) are a rich source of genetic diversity for crop improvement. Combining ecogeographic and phylogenetic techniques can inform both conservation and breeding. Geographic occurrence, bioclimatic, and biophysical data were used to predict species distributions, range overlap and niche occupancy in 36 taxa closely related to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Taxa lacking comprehensive ex situ conservation were identified. The predicted distributions for 36 Helianthus taxa identified substantial range overlap and asymmetry and niche conservatism. Specific taxa (e.g., Helianthus deblis Nutt., Helianthus anomalus Blake, and Helianthus divaricatus L.) were identified as targets for traits of interest, particularly for abiotic stress tolerance and adaptation to extreme soil properties. The combination of techniques demonstrates the potential for publicly available ecogeographic and phylogenetic data to facilitate the identification of possible sources of abiotic stress traits for plant breeding programs. Much of the primary genepool (wild H. annuus) occurs in extreme environments indicating that introgression of targeted traits may be relatively straightforward. Sister taxa in Helianthus have greater range overlap than more distantly related taxa within the genus. This adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that in plants (unlike some animal groups), geographic isolation may not be necessary for speciation.\",\n",

Sentinel sites were established and top- and subsoil samples were collected from each subplot at 0-20 cm and 20-50 cm depth increments, respectively, and pooled (composited) into one sample for each plot and depth, resulting in a total of 320 standard soil samples per sentinel site (V\\u00e5gen et al., 2010). These samples were analyzed using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. NIR spectral measurements were conducted through regional laboratories in eastern, southern and West Africa (V\\u00e5gen et al., 2010). The NIR spectral laboratory network used standard instrumentation and standard operating procedures to ensure reproducibility of results among laboratories and over time (V\\u00e5gen et al., 2010).

Land degradation is, however, widespread and improved targeting of land management interventions is needed, taking into account the variability of soil properties that affect agricultural productivity and land degradation risk across landscapes. In the current study we demonstrate the utility of Landsat ETM + imagery for landscape-level assessments of land degradation risk and soil condition through a combination of systematic field methodologies, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and ensemble modeling techniques. The approaches presented allow for the development of maps at spatial scales that are appropriate for making spatially explicit management recommendations. Field data and soil samples collected from 38 sites, each 100 km2, were used to develop predictive models that were applied as part of a case study to an independent dataset from four sites in Ethiopia. The predictions based on Landsat reflectance were robust, with R-squared values of 0.86 for pH and 0.79 for soil organic carbon (SOC), and were used to create predicted surfaces (maps) for these soil properties. Further, models were developed for the mapping of the occurrence of soil erosion and root depth restrictions within 50 cm of the soil surface (RDR50), with an accuracy o f about 80% for both variables. The maps generated from these models were used to assess the spatial distribution of soil pH and SOC, which are important indicators of soil condition, and land degradation risk factors in order to target relevant management options.\",\n",

RAVA objectives include: (a) to understand smallholder resource constraints and livelihood opportunities in Amazonian forested landscapes and to develop principles and options for improved resource management systems on their land; (b) to improve understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with integrating agroforestry and smallholder agriculture in the Amazon into landscape approaches to natural resource management and rural livelihood security; (c) to develop methods and approaches to link research findings into improved natural resource management at farm and landscape level in diverse Amazonian contexts, seeking to optimize returns to household income, nutrition and system nutrients; harmonize interactions among adjacent landscape units and resource users; and empower local communities to sustain these efforts; and (d) to create a solid economic regional data set on smallholder household reliance on forests/ agroforests. RAVA activities have been supported during the years 2008 to 2010 by the Institutional Development Fund of the World Bank, along with inputs from the participating institutions in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. RAVA members currently interact in generating the regional database and analyzing the location-specific data, in order to generate publications and contributions to public policy. ======================================================================================================== =================== La Red de Estudios de las Condiciones Amaz\\u00f3nicas de Vida y Ambiente (RAVA) fue formada a mediados de 2007, con el objetivo de analizar el uso y la dependencia de las comunidades amaz\\u00f3nicas respecto a los recursos naturales, evaluando de qu\\u00e9 manera las actividades forestales, agroforestales y agr\\u00edcolas contribuyen para su bienestar y para la conservaci\\u00f3n ambiental.

      "        \"description\": \"This survey was conducted during the \\\"Policies for Improved Land Management Project in Uganda, 1999-2003.\\\" The long term objective of the project was to contribute to improved land management in Uganda, in order to increase agricultural productivity, reduce poverty and ensure sustainable use of natural resources, with an immediate purpose of helping policy makers identify and assess policy, institutional and technological strategies to improve land management. The questionnaires were administered to 107 communities, the lowest administrative units in Uganda called Local Council 1 or LC1. The study region covered most of Uganda, including more densely populated and more secure areas in the southwest, central, eastern and parts of the north, representing seven of the nine major farming systems of the country. Within the study region, communities were selected using a stratified random sample, with the stratification based on population density and development domains defined by the different agro-ecological and market access zones. One hundred villages were selected in this way. Additional communities were purposely selected in southwest Uganda, where the African Highlands Initiative is conducting research, and in Iganga district, where the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) is conducting research. Topics covered in the LC1 survey included community concerns and priorities, establishment and change of local council boundaries, population change, use of local council revenue, infrastructure and services, programs and organizations, land rights, and collective resource management. Usually, each LC1 had one village, i.e. a cluster of households living in the neighborhood. In the case where the LC1 had more than one village, a village was randomly selected for the village level survey. Topics in the village survey included livelihood strategies, land use, land tenure and land markets, labor, wage rates and credit, crop production, commercialization and management, livestock management and commercialization, tree product and commercialization. In both the LC1 and village surveys, interviews were conducted with a group of representative people from each selected community.\",\n",

The Task Force also accumulates data on performance of new elite lines, thereby facilitating varietal release procedures.

The activities conducted by the Task Force consists of a series of consecutive trials. Promising breeding lines developed by AfricaRice or by national and international partners, such as IRRI, CIAT and the NARS are nominated for evaluation in one or several rice cultivation environments: rainfed lowland, irrigated lowland, rainfed upland, high elevation and mangrove. All nominated lines should be fixed and accompanied by supporting data on traits incorporated during the breeding process and with information on yield performance. These characteristics are checked at AfricaRice before incorporation into the network. The first phase (MET, Multi-Environment Testing) consists of an initial evaluation of about 100 lines selected from the nominated lines.

Such sites may be at an experimental station under optimal management to evaluate yield potential, or may be \\u2018hot spots\\u2019 to check the performance of the nominations in a stressed growth environment.

Based on the data collected, observations by the breeders and the opinion of stakeholder groups, NARS partners select up to 10 lines. Further, NARS evaluated these lines in at least three sites per country and during one or more growing seasons, depending on varietal release requirements.

Each national partner evaluates these lines at sites in his/her country. Such sites may be at an experimental station under optimal management to evaluate yield potential, or may be \\u2018hot spots\\u2019 to check the performance of the nominations in a stressed growth environment. Trials are replicated three times and include at least a common and a local check. The second phase (PET,Participatory Evaluation Trial) serves to evaluate and confirm the performance of the selected lines. These lines are cultivated using the same experimental design with 3 replications. An important feature of PET is that farmer and other stakeholders such as miller and traders are invited to participate in varietal selection and their opinion on the performance of all entries (i.e. participatory varietal selection, PVS) collected. Based on the data collected, observations by the breeders and the opinion of stakeholder groups, NARS partners select up to 10 lines. Further, NARS evaluated these lines in at least three sites per country and during one or more growing seasons, depending on varietal release requirements. All stakeholders are again invited to get acquainted with the new lines and voice their opinion to help select lines for further advancement. Among the 10 lines, farmers are invited to select three lines and cultivate these in their own fields, together with a common check and their own variety.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"In 2010, the Africa-wide Rice Breeding Task Force was launched by AfricaRice involving National Agricultural Research System (NARS) from about 30 countries. The objectives of the network are to evaluate the stability of traits incorporated in breeding processes and to identify varieties best fit to growth conditions in target regions and to markets. The Task Force also accumulates data on performance of new elite lines, thereby facilitating varietal release procedures. Furthermore, by exposing breeders from NARS and farmers to these elite lines during the testing phase, dissemination will be facilitated. The activities conducted by the Task Force consists of a series of consecutive trials. Promising breeding lines developed by AfricaRice or by national and international partners, such as IRRI, CIAT and the NARS are nominated for evaluation in one or several rice cultivation environments: rainfed lowland, irrigated lowland, rainfed upland, high elevation and mangrove. All nominated lines should be fixed and accompanied by supporting data on traits incorporated during the breeding process and with information on yield performance. These characteristics are checked at AfricaRice before incorporation into the network. The first phase (MET, Multi-Environment Testing) consists of an initial evaluation of about 100 lines selected from the nominated lines. Each national partner evaluates these lines at sites in his/her country. Such sites may be at an experimental station under optimal management to evaluate yield potential, or may be \\u2018hot spots\\u2019 to check the performance of the nominations in a stressed growth environment.

We estimate the degree to which countries use crops from regions of diversity other than their own (\\u2018foreign crops\\u2019), and quantify changes in this usage over the past 50 years. Countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume. Foreign crops are extensively used in food supplies (68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean are derived from foreign crops) and production systems (69.3% of crops grown are foreign). Foreign crop usage has increased significantly over the past 50 years, including in countries with high indigenous crop diversity. The results provide a novel perspective on the ongoing globalization of food systems worldwide, and bolster evidence for the importance of international collaboration on genetic resource conservation and exchange.\",\n",

Map quadrangle number: NI50-11. Edition statement: AMS - ed. 1. Printed in December 1957; the source map was compiled in 1954 from the best available large scale maps of China. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image. AMS Series L500 topographic maps were prepared and printed by the AMS, US Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s and 1960s. AMS Series L500 maps are in English, with modified Wade-Giles romanized Chinese place and feature names; many names also appear as Chinese ideographs. Each source map in the series is printed in color at a scale of 1:250,000. AMS Series L500 maps are typical topographic maps portraying both natural and manmade features. They show and name works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. They also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 100 meters, with some sheets having supplemental 50 meter contours, form lines, and/or spot heights. Please pay close attention to map collar information on projections, spheroid, planimetric revision methods and dates, and keys to grid numbering and other numbers which appear inside the neatline.\",\n",
